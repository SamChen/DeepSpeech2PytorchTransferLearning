vf5-11,And when you come back in a few days bring Eileen
vf5-12,Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar
vf5-13,The date was nearly eighteen years old
vf5-14,They were the presage of storm
vf5-15,Down there the earth was already swelling with life
vf5-16,For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
vf5-17,She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled
vf5-18,Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
vf5-19,Tomorrow I'm going after that bear he said
vf5-20,If not let's say our prayers and go to bed
vf3-31,Instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
vf3-32,He was wounded in the arm

vf3-34,Her words sent a strange chill through Philip
vf3-35,He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
vf3-06,Death had come with terrible suddenness
vf3-07,Philip bent lower and stared into the face of the dead man
vf3-08,He made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
vf3-09,The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by
vf3-10,The singing voice approached rapidly
